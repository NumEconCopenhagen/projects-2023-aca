# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **"Gender norms in home production and labor market supply"** and is a dynamic model on households time decision in home- and labor market production including the presense of children.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Conclusion**
Introducing stochastic children in a dynamic framework of labor and household production with endogenous wages, allows us to get deeper understanding of the causes of the gender gap.
