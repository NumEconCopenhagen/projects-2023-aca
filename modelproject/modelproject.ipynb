    "Our model project is **motivated** by a model from the study “Are Marriage-Related Taxes and Social Security Benefits Holding Back Female Labor Supply?” by Borella et al. (forthcoming). We are solving and simulating a $T$-period labor supply model with two-earner couples, where $M$ symbols a male and $F$ a female. For simplicity we assume that couples cannot divorce nor save. Individuals can either choose to spend time on home production or working in the labor market. The goal is to examine the labor supply in home- and market production given different levels of human capital and based on the presense of children..........\n",

Therefore, as female home production goes up, the male agent can produce more in the home for fewer hours compared to what he can bring home of consumption from working in the labor market.

Partly due to women becoming less productive in the labor market - namely due to these differences in preferences that we interpret as norms.
