# Exam project

Our exam project is based on the content of the following problem areas:
Problem 1) Optimal taxation with government consumption 
Problem 2) Labor adjustment costs
Problem 3) Global optimizer with refined multi-start

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [exam.ipynb](exam.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Conclusion**
Introducing stochastic children in a dynamic framework of labor and household production with endogenous wages, allows us to get deeper understanding of the causes of the gender gap.
