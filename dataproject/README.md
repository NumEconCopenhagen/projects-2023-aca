# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Gender inequality across OECD-countries** and is about the potential causes in the development of the gender gap.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).
We do not use the dataproject.py file. 


We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Family.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/*) 
2. Gender gap.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/*)
3. netchildcare costs.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/*)
4. Parental leave.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

Moreover, Github does not execute ineractive widgets. In order to display our interactive plot, you will need to run our code in VScode.

**Conclusion**
The average gender gap and net child costs for all OECD countries have been decreasing in the considered period. High child care costs, lack of access to formal child care and little parental leave for fathers appear to be important drivers of the gender gap.
