# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Gender inequality across OECD-countries** and is about the potential causes in the development of the gender gap.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Family.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/*) 
2. Gender gap.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/*)
3. netchildcare costs.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/*)
4. Parental leave.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
