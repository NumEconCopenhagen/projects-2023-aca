**Conclusion**
The simple model cannot explain the patterns of obsered data - namely why women use more time on home production than men even when their labor market earnings go up. We extend the model by introducing an extra amount of disutility of labor market work for women and interpret this as norm. With this extention, we are able to fit the model to the estimates from Siminski and Yetsenga (2022).
