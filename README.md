This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project.
3. Model project.

**Problems** We have not been able to solve the problem of dividing by zero encountered in double_scalars in the CES-production function that we apply in both our inagural project and model project. We have tried many things but eventually had to give up. Note that the code can still run even though we have this error.
